The provided code is a comprehensive machine learning project for breast cancer detection. It utilizes various supervised learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer based on a given dataset.
**Key Features**
1. Data Preprocessing: The code performs essential data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding the target variable.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The code includes extensive EDA, including visualizations of feature distributions, correlation heatmaps, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
3. Model Training and Evaluation: The code trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models, including KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and SVC. It uses techniques like GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to ensure robust model performance.
4. Model Comparison and Selection: The code compares the performance of the trained models based on various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. It then identifies the best-performing model based on a chosen metric, in this case, accuracy.
5.Visualization: The code includes visualizations of the PCA-transformed data and the decision boundary of the SVC model, providing insights into the underlying data structure and the model's decision-making process.
